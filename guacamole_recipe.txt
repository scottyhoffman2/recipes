Ingredients:

2 avocados
1 tomatillo
1/4 Spanish onion
1/8 shallot
1 small vine ripe tomato
Small bunch of diced fresh cilantro*
1 quarter lime
Dash of lemon juice
Salt & pepper to tast

Start with the avocados and just mash everything together. You want the guacamole smooth; if it’s too chunky you’ll break chips or just get hunks of avocado with no other flavor. 

*The key ingredient, not to be left out.
